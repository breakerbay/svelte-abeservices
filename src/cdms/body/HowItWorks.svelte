        <h4><a name="WhatistheCDMS">Using the CDMS on Projects</a></h4>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The CDMS manages the
            development and sign-off of checking of work on a <strong>Project. </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Inspection
                and Test Plans (ITP's)</strong> are the tool used to plan the checking
            of work (i.e. the inspection and test processes) for activities on a construction
            project.&nbsp; &nbsp;ITP's are the central plank of Quality Assurance on
            construction projects. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each <strong>Project</strong> has
            one or more <strong>ITP's</strong>covering the activities on the project,
            e.g. for bricklaying, roofing, etc.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>In the CDMS an <strong>ITP</strong> contains
            a number of steps that define the process for doing the work (called <strong>Process
                Steps</strong>) and the points at which checks (verification) are carried
            out (called <strong>Verification Points</strong>). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Process Steps </strong>are
            the steps taken to deliver the work. <strong>Verification Points</strong> define
            the checks to be done at specific points in the work process to confirm/demonstrate
            compliance with specified requirements. &nbsp;On the CDMS web site both <strong>Process
                Steps</strong> and <strong>Verification Points</strong> are visible but
            only <strong>Verification Points </strong>are downloaded onto the PDA (Palm).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">        <strong>Verification Points </strong>have
            one or more <strong>Criteria</strong> setting
            out in detail what specified requirements must be met.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A <strong>Verification
            Point </strong>may have some explanation attached to it, defined in a<strong> Details </strong>section,
            explaining the relevance of the <strong>Verification Point, </strong>&nbsp;such
            as references to relevant industry standards.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Additionally, there is
            the provision on the PDA to record <strong>Follow up Actions</strong> when
            a <strong>Verification Point</strong> can't be ticked off the first time
            it is checked. &nbsp;(In the Quality Assurance Standard ISO 9001:2000 these
            are termed a non-conformance. The CDMS provides a very easy way to record
            these.&nbsp; This helps control work and provides valuable feedback to
            identify improvements.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>ITP's</strong> are
            assigned <strong>Work Lots.</strong> A <strong>Work Lot</strong> defines
            the work that is covered by the check being undertaken.&nbsp; As an example
            an <strong>ITP (</strong>for say &quot;Roof Cladding&quot;) may have assigned
            to it two or more <strong>Work Lots, </strong>e.g. for the East side of the
            building and for the West side of the building.</font></p>

        <h4><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="A2"></a>Getting
            started</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To get started a user
            first needs to sign up with ABE Services Pty Ltd. Once signed up the user
            will be provided with a password to access the CDMS. The initial user will
            be given access as an administrator. As an administrator the user will
            be able to assign any other licence holders as an administrator or a checker.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> An administrator has
            the ability to establish projects, create/modify ITP's and associated work
            lots, and assigns specific ITP's to individual Checkers. A Checker, on
            the other hand can only complete the activities viewed on his/her allocated
            PDA, as well being able to download and upload data to the PDA.</font></p>

        <h4><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="A3"></a>Setting
            up ITP&#8217;s</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The process of developing
            ITP's has been simplified by the provision of industry standard ITP templates.
            These templates are provided to users either directly by ABE Services Pty
            Ltd, or by a relevant industry association to its members.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> These ITP templates
            can be copied into a user area and then into a project and used as is,
            or modified to suit the particular project. If needed the user can create
            ITP's from scratch. Because ITP's for a project are drawn from a list
            of templates developed/copied/modified by the user, then these user templates
            can be used over and over again from project to project. In fact entire
            projects can be copied to like projects to further speed up ITP preparation.<br>
            The setting up of projects and ITP's is undertaken by the user assigned
            the role of administrator.</font></p>

            data</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When ready to undertake
            an inspection to collect compliance data, the Checker would synchronise
            his/her PDA with the remote database to download the compliance/inspection
            documentation to the PDA.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The user then takes
            the PDA &#8216;into the field&#8217; and completes the
            activities required by the compliance/inspection planning documentation
            loaded  onto the PDA, by recording data into the mobile device as required
            by the downloaded  documentation. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The data recorded either
            confirms compliance with requirements, or where compliance cannot be achieved,
            identifies a follow-up action to be undertaken before a subsequent inspection
            is carried out. The action also identifies if there are client requirements
            to be addressed. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On completion of inspection
            activities the user synchronises the PDA with the database, uploading the
            data collected.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The uploaded data populates
            the compliance/inspection documentation to provide a record of compliance
            actions.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> All activity on the

            and associated compliance data in an appropriate reporting format (onscreen
            or printed reports). Reports available cover the ITP, the ITP with collected
            data (the name of the checker, the data and time when each activity was signed

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the administrator
            wishes to, the administrator can grant to external parties an  on line
            view of the ITP's and other reports. This allows project compliance information
            to be shared with others (clients, superintendents, project managers) in
            real time. These external users may only view data. They cannot alter data.</font></p>

            Capacity Limitation</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Attention of users and potential users of the CDMS is drawn to
            limitations on the size and number of projects that may be downloaded
            to PDAs (Palms). As these limits vary depending on the PDA used and
            the project(s) involved it is not possible to provide precise
            guidance on the limits that may be encountered. When the download
            capacity is exceeded not all the project information is downloaded to
            the PDA.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To date projects with of the order of 25 Inspection and Test Plans
            and 10 worklots have been successfully downloaded. Projects with
            significantly more worklots but fewer ITPs have also been
            successfully handled. More than ten projects have also been
            successfully downloaded to a single Palm.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The download capacity
            may be adversely affected if the free space on  the PDA (Palm) is less
            than 5 Mb and there is a significant skew in  the ITP to Work Lot ratio,
            ie a high number of Work Lots to the number  of ITPs or vice versa.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The download capacity of the CDMS indicated above has been sufficient
            for trial projects undertaken in 2004. These projects were for
            building, civil and landscape works up to the order of $2,000,000.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Users looking at employing the CDMS on larger projects where capacity
