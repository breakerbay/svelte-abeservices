            <p>(a) You may terminate
                this agreement at any time for any reason on written notice to us. <br>
                (b) We may terminate this agreement immediately
                if you, or any person using your PDA, or your personal

        <h4>12. General</h4>
        <blockquote>
            <p>(a) You must not assign
                any of your rights and responsibilities under this agreement, unless
                we agree in writing to your request for transfer. We can assign any of
                our rights and obligations at any time. <br>
                (b) If any term of this agreement is invalid or unenforceable,
                it will be severed from this agreement and the remainder
                of this agreement will remain valid and effective. <br>
                (c) You acknowledge that you enter into this agreement entirely
                as a result of your own enquiries and that you do not rely on any
                statement, representation or promise by us or on our behalf not
                expressly set out in this agreement.<br>
                (d) You accordingly release us and each of our officers, agents and
                advisers from all claims, suits, demands of every
                kind (including negligence) arising from the relationship of the parties
                concerning this agreement before it was signed and from the negotiations
                leading to it.<br>
                (e) Any failure by us at any time or times to require performance
                of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a
                later time to enforce the same unless the same is waived in writing. <br>
                (f) This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
                with the laws of the Australian Capital Territory without
                regard to its conflict of law rules. Any legal proceeding arising out
                or relating to this agreement will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
                of any court of the Australian Capital Territory and you irrevocably
                consent to the jurisdiction of such courts. The terms set forth in
                this agreement constitute the final, complete and exclusive agreement with
                respect to the CDMS Software and may not be contradicted, explained
                or supplemented by evidence of any prior agreement, any contemporaneous
                oral agreement or any consistent additional terms.</p>
