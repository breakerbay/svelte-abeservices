Attached is a word version of the web site Richard emailed the link for with suggested first cut of minimum changes shown in Track Changes.

(For convenience the link is: https://abeservices.netlify.app/ )



The links in the text on the Home page of the web site Richard sent did not work so I have copied in pages from a pdf record I had of the old web site.    The web site Richard has set up may not also be the most recent old one.  My old copy is a bit different so some pages on the word version may differ a bit.



As indicated I suggest we need a new home screen along the lines John and I developed.  Copy attached.



At our ZOOM meeting we said we needed a disclaimer.  We also need something to protect the copyright and cover the privacy requirements.



To do this effectively we need to form a Partnership.  As indicted on the marked up web site we can fudge it without a partnership but it would be questionable how good the disclaimer is and  we canâ€™t say much about IP.



Once we have a general agreement on the form of the web site, it will need a more detailed review.  I have not done that at this stage until we have the general shape agreed.



As mentioned , there is not that much involved in setting up a partnership.  The issue may be on whether when we have the Apple Store up and running we can switch to a Company.  I will look further into this.
