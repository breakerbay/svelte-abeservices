Quality means doing it right when

no one is looking. Henry Ford

Uncontrolled variation is the enemy of quality. Demiing

Quality is generally transparent when present,

but easily recognized in its absence. Gillies

Quality is to give the customers what they want. Walton

The bitterness of poor quality remains

long after low pricing is forgotten.

“It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.” Deming

“Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren’t used to

an environment where excellence is expected.” Jobs
